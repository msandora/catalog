No content from the Web Site may be downloaded in violation of United States law.</p>
            <p>18. General. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision by us, and no waiver of any term shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term o any other term. These Terms and Conditions, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Sheer Science, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Sheer Science. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and this shall not affect the validity of the other provisions of our Terms and Conditions, which shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms and Conditions, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Sheer Science without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>
            <p>19. Binding Arbitration / Class Waiver.
              (a) You agree that for any dispute directly or indirectly with Sheer Science you will first contact us at 800-681-0366 and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we are not able to resolve the dispute satisfactorily within a period of sixty (60) days, you agree not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury, and agree that all disputes, controversies and claims related to these Terms (including the Privacy Policy, Sheer Science Services and any order for any product from Sheer Science) (each a "Claim"), shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration as described in this Section, which may be initiated by either party by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.
              </p>
            <p>(b) YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL CLAIM, DISPUTE OR OTHER CONTROVERSY BETWEEN YOU AND SHEER SCIENCE ARISING OUT OF OR OTHERWISE RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SHEER SCIENCE SERVICES, INCLUDING CONTROVERSIES RELATING TO THE APPLICABILITY, ENFORCEABILITY OR VALIDITY OF ANY PROVISION OF THESE TERMS OR SHEER SCIENCE'S PRIVACY POLICY AND PRACTICES (COLLECTIVELY "DISPUTES"), SHALL BE RESOLVED IN CONFIDENTIAL BINDING ARBITRATION CONDUCTED BEFORE ONE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATOR FROM THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA"), RATHER THAN IN A COURT, AS DESCRIBED HEREIN. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE AAA'S COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND, IF THE ARBITRATOR DEEMS THEM APPLICABLE, THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (COLLECTIVELY "RULES AND PROCEDURES"). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY FORFEITING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND TO OTHERWISE PROCEED IN A LAWSUIT IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT.</p>
            <p>(c) Payment of arbitration costs will be governed by the AAA's fee schedule, unless you are able to show that your portion will be prohibitive as compared to litigation costs, in which case Sheer Science will pay as much of your arbitration costs as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to litigation costs. Sheer Science also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all arbitration costs imposed by the AAA. Each party agrees to pay its own attorneys' fees and expenses unless there is a governing statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid attorneys' fees and expenses.</p>
            <p>(d) The arbitration may be conducted in Chicago, Illinois or, upon the plaintiff's request, in the city closest to plaintiff's location where AAA maintains an office, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on all parties subject to these Terms and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>(e) Any award in any arbitration initiated hereunder shall be limited to monetary damages and shall include no injunction or direction to any party other than the direction to pay a monetary amount. Further, the arbitrator(s) shall have no authority to award punitive, consequential or other damages not measured by the prevailing party's actual damages in any arbitration initiated under this section, except as may be required by statute. Nothing in this section shall be deemed as preventing Sheer Science from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of Sheer Science’s proprietary interests.</p>
            <p>(f) For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at www.adr.org.</p>
            <p>(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent the Dispute arises from:</p>
            <p>(1) a violation of your or Sheer Science's intellectual property rights in any manner; or</p>
            <p>(2) any claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, unauthorized use or a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</p>
            <p>then both parties agree that a party may seek injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in a state or federal court consistent with the "Governing Law" section below, and both parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such court's jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.</p>
            <p>(h) To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, all Disputes shall be resolved by binding confidential arbitration on an individual basis. You expressly agree that no other Disputes shall be consolidated or joined with your Dispute, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.</p>
            <p>(i) YOU AND SHEER SCIENCE AGREE THAT THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES, THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.</p>
            <p>(j) You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Web Site or our Terms and Conditions must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
              20. Additional Assistance. If you do not understand any of the foregoing Terms and Conditions or if you have any questions or comments, we invite you to contact us:
